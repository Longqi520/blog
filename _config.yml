    Hi, I'm Florian or [`@qwtel`](https://www.twitter.com/qwtel), which isn't an acronym,
    I just [wanted a short username](http://qwtel.com/how-to-find-a-short-username) and that one happened to be available.

    Read my thoughts on [#software](http://qwtel.com/tag/software) and [#cryptoeconomics](http://qwtel.com/tag/cryptoeconomics).
